# Face Verification System

This project implements a real-time face verification and liveness detection system using a webcam feed. It verifies a user against a provided reference image and performs a liveness check by detecting blinks.

---

## âœ… Features

- **Face Verification**: Compares faces detected in the live webcam feed against a pre-registered reference image.
- **Liveness Detection**: Uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect blinks, ensuring the user is live and not a static photo or video.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video frames live for immediate feedback.
- **User Feedback**: Displays real-time status updates for face detection, verification, and liveness checks.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Before running the application, ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

- `dlib` â€“ face detection and facial landmark prediction
- `face_recognition` â€“ face encoding and comparison
- `opencv-python` â€“ webcam access and video/image processing
- `numpy` â€“ numerical operations
- `requests` â€“ downloading the reference image
- `Pillow` â€“ image handling (PIL)

Youâ€™ll also need:
- `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` â€“ Dlib's pre-trained facial landmark model  
  âž¤ [Download here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2) and extract it into the project directory.
